GraphCast Global Forecast System (GraphCast GFS)    
######################

**The GraphCastGFS system** is a weather forecast model built upon the pre-trained Google DeepMind's GraphCast Machine Learning Weather Prediction (MLWP) model. It is set up by the National Centers for Environmental Prediction (NCEP) to produce medium range global forecasts. The model runs in two operation modes on different vertical resolutions: 13 and 37 pressure levels. The horizontal resolution is a 0.25 degree latitude-longitude grid (about 28 km). The model runs 4 times a day at 00Z, 06Z, 12Z, and 1Z cycles. Major surface and atmospheric fields including temperature, wind components, geopotential height, specific humidity, and vertical velocity are available. The products are 6-hourly forecasts up to 10 days.
